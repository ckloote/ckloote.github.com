{% include JB/setup %}
My name is Charles Kloote, and I'm the Principal Systems Engineer for the [GlobalNOC at Indiana University](http://globalnoc.iu.edu). The GlobalNOC provides network operations, engineering, and design services for leading research and education wide-area networks, including a custom-developed network management, measurement, and monitoring suite built entirely on open-source software. I, along with a team of talented systems engineers, provide production support and systems management expertise for the entire GlobalNOC platform.

Prior to joining GlobalNOC, I worked for two large Internet Service Providers, two web-based startup, and an established e-commerce site, providing a variety of services including technical support, internal IT, business continuity and disaster recovery planning, and production operations.

My education includes studies at Purdue University's [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) and IUPUI's schools of [Informatics](http://informatics.iupui.edu/) and [Computer and Information Science](http://cs.iupui.edu/).

I've lived my entire life in Indiana, growing up South Bend before moving to West Lafayette for school. I now live Indianapolis with my wife [Beth](http://www.kibi.org/kib_staff_and_board_members/beth_kloote) and our two cats in our 100 year old home in Indy's [Meridian Kessler neighborhood](http://www.mkna.org/).

I'm interested in politics and public policy as well, particularly as it relates to technology and the Internet, but hardly limited to those areas. My politics are probably most easily described as "moderate liberal", but contain a mix of both libertarian and more leftist views depending on the issue.

Other hobbies include books, music, film, gaming of all kinds,  and hiking/walking. I'm reachable publicly most easily on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ckloote) via good old-fashioned [email](ckloote@gmail.com).
